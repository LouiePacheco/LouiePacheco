### Hi, I'm Louis! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹                           
I'm a front-end developer

I am a self taught developer who previously worked in IT as a computer repair technician, and built movie/photo studio sets. Now my day to day looks more like working with clients on how to improve their online presence and web layout, and my back thanks me for it. I have experience in CSS (flex, grid) HTML5, JavaScript (J-query), and basic SEO principles.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Getting clients who need a site constructed
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:   React & UX design 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:             Coding, or building websites, SEO principles, basketball trivia, kickboxing, fine art, or cars!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:          [Hi] Louispacheco101@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact:                 I also have a degree in Psychology
